        <h2>A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I’m Mark Rainiel G. Laguilles, a 20-year-old just trying to figure things out as I go. I’m always curious about life and love learning new things, whether it’s through experiences or from people around me.
        <br><br>
        I enjoy spending time with my younger siblings and find a lot of joy in simple moments with them and I also love my parents.
        <br><br>
        Life is a journey, and I’m constantly growing, learning, and discovering new things about myself. I’m excited to see where this adventure will take me next!</p>
